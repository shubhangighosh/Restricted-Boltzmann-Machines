# Restricted-Boltzmann-Machines
RBMs were trained on a dataset of 60000 images to obtain hidden representations.  
RBMs were trained using:  
1. Constrastive Divergence  
2. Gibbs Sampling  
T-SNE plots of hidden representations were generated for various experiments.
The results of the conducted experiments can be found [here](https://github.com/shubhangighosh/Restricted-Boltzmann-Machines/blob/master/Report.pdf).
  
To test, run :   

python train.py -lr 		<learning rate>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;				-batch_size <batch size>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;				-method 	<cd or gibbs>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;				-k			<k for cd>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;				-r 	 		<r for cd>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;				-n			<num hidden units>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;				-p 			<momentum>
